# I dont like useless trash
Firstly, I started my professional journey as an engineering student and, even without exercising my professional career, I'll always look at thing from the engineer point of view so that is why I don't like useless trash, even if they are wrapped in silk and gold. **I love to design things that are, first, functional, and then, beautiful**. Those are the kind of projects that are most rewarding for me and are the ones that excite me the most.

## What
I really love the approach that said that the functionality comes before the style o design. I really love beautiful things, the kind of things that makes you feel like everything is balanced and in place, but for me, it doesn't mean a damn thing if it doesn't serve its functionality. That is why:

*I create things that are fully functional and stetically pleasing, so people can enjoy using them as much as they want.*

## How
I use a combination of knowledge that I had already acquire throughout the years in engineering, marketing and design to make things that can be easily accessible to the public but brings all the necessary functionality so the experience can be as captivating as it can be. 

*I use Markdown or other writing tools to write down my ideas, explore the possibilities and organize the main idea for the first time. Then I use Figma, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop or any other design tool to combine the information with graphics and other components needed to start giving to it that look and feel that we like. Finally, I make the final touches to the experience in HTML and CSS for the final result.* 

## Why
Every time, since humans started to think rationally, man has used their creativity to solve problems that seem to be outside the conventional possibilities. I didn't become a designer because I liked to make beautifully pleasing things or because I had a passion for art or something like that. In my opinion, I became a designer because I have a strong desire to create, to surpass my possibilities, to imagine a world different from the one that exists at the moment and have a means of making it reality. I really think that creating is one of the most powerful thing that resonates inside me. Creativity drives myself in a sense that everything I have seen, I like to understand it, to understand the principles behind it, so I can get to know how to do it if I had to replicate it again or how to use its basic principles to make something *"brand new"*. So, I'll start defining my why by sharing with you this quote that Albert Einstein supposedly said:

> Creativity is Intelligence Having Fun. -Albert Einstein

So my why could be defined today as:

*To explore the possibilities given by nature, humans or some sort of superior order, so we can make stuff that allow us to progress into a better state*

## About
Oh boy, it is always dificult to describe myself everytime I try, not because I don't know me well but because I'm always changing like everything else. I'm always looking for new and exiting ways to do things, trying to learn something I don't know yet and looking at ways to integrate it on my processes. Maybe I'm not the most profesional guy on any of my fields but I can asure that I'm really recursive, analytical and detail oriented in almost everything I do. I have learned a lot throut my process, I discovered so many interesting things and make a lot of experiments tha not always result as I originally planed. From all that I discovered that finished and inperfect is better that perfect but unfinished. You can always inproove something that is not perfect but lauch by iteratin with the help of others and make something way better than you can imagine but when you are the only one that can use your product, you become your own limit... My goal is to be as limiteless as I can.
If you wana know more about me, here you can find a more extensive an verbose description about myself (But i must confess that even for me it seems a little bit boring, read it at your own risk) >>>
