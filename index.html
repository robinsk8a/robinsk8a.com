        Firstly, I started my professional journey as an engineering student
        and, even without exercising my professional career, I'll always look at
        thing from the engineer point of view so that is why I don't like
        useless trash, even if they are wrapped in silk and gold. I love to
        design things that are, first, functional, and then, beautiful. Those
        are the kind of projects that are most rewarding for me and are the ones
        that excite me the most.

            I really love the approach that said that the functionality comes
            before the style o design. I really love beautiful things, the kind of
            things that makes you feel like everything is balanced and in place,
            but for me, it doesn't mean a damn thing if it doesn't serve its
            functionality. That is why:

            I use a combination of knowledge that I had already acquire throughout
            the years in engineering, marketing and design to make things that can
            be easily accessible to the public but brings all the necessary
            functionality so the experience can be as captivating as it can be.

            I use Markdown or other writing tools to write down my ideas, explore
            the possibilities and organize the main idea for the first time. Then
            I use Figma, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop or any other design
            tool to combine the information with graphics and other components
            needed to start giving to it that look and feel that we like. Finally,
            I make the final touches to the experience in HTML and CSS for the
            final result.

            Every time, since humans started to think rationally, man has used
            their creativity to solve problems that seem to be outside the
            conventional possibilities. I didn't become a designer because I liked
            to make beautifully pleasing things or because I had a passion for art
            or something like that. In my opinion, I became a designer because I
            have a strong desire to create, to surpass my possibilities, to
            imagine a world different from the one that exists at the moment and
            have a means of making it reality. I really think that creating is one
            of the most powerful thing that resonates inside me. Creativity drives
            myself in a sense that everything I have seen, I like to understand
            it, to understand the principles behind it, so I can get to know how
            to do it if I had to replicate it again or how to use its basic
            principles to make something "brand new". So, I'll start defining my
            why by sharing with you this quote that Albert Einstein supposedly
            said:
          </p>

            Creativity is Intelligence Having Fun. -Albert Einstein
          </q>
          <p class="why__text why-cont__text">
            So my why could be defined today as:
          </p>
          <p class="why__emphais why-cont__emphasis">
            To explore the possibilities given by nature, humans or some sort of
            superior order, so we can make stuff that allow us to progress into a
            better state

        Oh boy, it is always dificult to describe myself everytime I try, not
        because I don't know me well but because I'm always changing like
        everything else. I'm always looking for new and exiting ways to do
        things, trying to learn something I don't know yet and looking at ways
        to integrate it on my processes. Maybe I'm not the most profesional guy
        on any of my fields but I can asure that I'm really recursive,
        analytical and detail oriented in almost everything I do. I have learned
        a lot throut my process, I discovered so many interesting things and
        make a lot of experiments tha not always result as I originally planed.
        From all that I discovered that finished and inperfect is better that
        perfect but unfinished. You can always inproove something that is not
        perfect but lauch by iteratin with the help of others and make something
        way better than you can imagine but when you are the only one that can
        use your product, you become your own limit... My goal is to be as
        limiteless as I can. If you wana know more about me, here you can find a
        more extensive an verbose description about myself (But i must confess
        that even for me it seems a little bit boring, read it at your own risk)
